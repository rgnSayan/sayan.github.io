            It's a great idea, something very novel and unheard of before. Slice
            should incorporate this.

            A lot of people lend their credit limits independently, sometimes
            since their friends don't have access to funds, or for bank/shopping
            offers. By integrating this into the app, credibility can be
            introduced into the system, and I think this is a great idea Tarang

            It's very logical to share the unused credit. Would love to have and
            use this feature soon.
