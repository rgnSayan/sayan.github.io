            I am someone who is looking for better service everyday and I came
            across this idea of tiffin service on zomato. I love the idea
            because itâ€™s great to finally fix our food routine with this

            I moved to Bangalore 2 months back after working from home from last
            year. When I came out to stay on my own the most important thing
            that I couldnâ€™t manage was FOOD. With this model in place I can take
            a monthly subscription and just get home made food. I donâ€™t even
            have to buy groceries and hire a maid. This can make my life easy

            I am a student and I never lived without my Momâ€™s cooked food and
            when I came to college I was excited that I am going to get a
            variety of food on a daily basis. Well, after a month I realized
            that the mess food is so boring. Itâ€™s bad oil, unhealthy and I canâ€™t
            choose what I want to eat, there is a schedule they follow and I
            have to eat that. But with this Zomato service I can choose what I
            want to eat. I donâ€™t need to eat the same thing every Monday
            morning. Love the idea!
